# C++ Coding Challenge

## Requirements
Create a C++ program that can parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions. For example, on input **3+(5+(4*3))-12**, the program should return **8**. The program should also detect an invalid input and report an appropriate error.

**Supported Symbols**
- Positive and negative numbers.
- +, -, *, / and parentheses.

## Things to Keep in Mind
* Put more focus on code quality and less on speed.
* Your code will be evaluated based on: code structure, programming best practices and legibility.
* The git commit history (and git commit messages) will be also evaluated.
* Do not forget to include few details about the project in the README (e.g explain how you solved the problem, how to run the code â€¦).
